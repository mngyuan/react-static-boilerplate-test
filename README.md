react-static-boilerplate-test

Let this be a cautionary tale for those as foolish as I: [react-static-boilerplate](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate) isn't using react router and it's not, more importantly, doing real routing. I wanted something that, on a navigation link click, runs arbitrary JS and pushes an HTML5 history state. This just generates `<a href=...>` links for you easily.
Sigh.
