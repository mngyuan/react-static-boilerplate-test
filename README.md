react-static-boilerplate-test
===
Let this be a cautionary tale for those as foolish as I: [react-static-boilerplate] isn't using react router and it's not, more importantly, doing real routing. I wanted something that, on a navigation link click, runs arbitrary JS and pushes an HTML5 history state. This just generates <a href=...> links for you easily.
Sigh.
